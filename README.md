# e-commerce

## Description
Created a backend for a e-commerce site. Upon starting the server the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database. When I open API GET routes in INSOMNIA CORE for all and single Products, all and single Tags and all and single Category the data is displayed accordingly. When I test API POST, PUT, DELETE routes in INSOMNIA CORE I am successfully able to create, update, and delete data in the database.
